# Ban-Quasher

Did you get unfairly banned from Runescape even though you dindu nuffin!?  

Use the Ban Quasher to get unbanned to show Jagex they can't ban you even IF you broke the rules!

I created the Ban Quasher because Jagex permanently banned my account for no reason.  I was innocently playing Runescape when Jagex decided to be stupid and ban me.  My beloved, extremely high level account that I had since 2004 was gone.  All the time and love I spent into playing was wasted, all because Jagex wrongly thought I was botting.

I had enough of Jagex's abuse of innocent players.  I decided to use my awesome hacking powers for good and created a legit hack to unban myself!  Hahaha, stupid Jagex.  You cannot defeat Lusin.

Now I, Lusin, have given this legit hack to all Runescape players for free so you can get unbanned from Runescape as well.  Jagex is powerless against us.

Enjoy playing Runescape again.  And remember, you did nothing wrong.  ;)
